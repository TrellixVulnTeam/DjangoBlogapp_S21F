        <p>This professional Blog content creator has an eclectic collection of videos related to technology and culture, and expresses that diversity all over her "About Me" page.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>In addition to the vibrant self-portrait at the top of the page, Sara's first sentence tells you just how many people subscribe to her channel: 350,000. This is an important number to know for her potential video advertisers and collaborators who want to know how much exposure they'd get by working with her or advertising on her channel.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The colored tiles lining the page -- starting with the red one, as shown below -- also do a terrific job segmenting her work by the types of projects she takes up and for whom she's done them. That Intel logo in the second photo of Sara, below, is sure to turn some visitors' heads as they're perusing her website.</p>
